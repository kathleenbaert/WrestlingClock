# Wrestling Clock
This is a simple scoreboard and timer for a wrestling match. It was made by Kathleen Baert for coach Abe Graziano at Oak Creek High School. Initial MVP: October 30 - November 7, 2023.

Far from the greatest thing in the world, but seems to be getting the job done. Released under MIT License.
